# üìö Data Analysis and Book App Recommendation System

This project is a data analysis and app recommendation system focused on Google Play book-related apps. 
It was developed as part of an academic exercise to explore real-world data manipulation, cleaning, and interpretation using Python.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This repository contains Python scripts for:

- Cleaning and preparing a dataset of Android apps.
- Exploring app categories and user engagement.
- Calculating average install counts by app category.
- Recommending book apps based on install trends.

The project centers around drawing meaningful insights from data to better understand user behavior in app usage 
‚Äî particularly in the **Books and Reference** category.

The project avoids the use of popular libraries as Numpy or Pandas in order to test the user knowledge in Python functions, dictionaries,
lists, tuples and exploring data techniques.

## üß† Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- No external libraries (pure Python logic)

## üìå How to Run the Code

1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/Blue158/Data_Analysis_BookApp_Recommendation.git

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook or run the Python scripts inside the `/src/` directory.

3. Make sure your dataset is in the correct location (`/data/` folder).

## üìä Sample Insights

Some questions this project explores:

- Which apps should a developer focus on building for better visibility? 
- How to identify opportunity markets avaiable both in Android and Iphone?
- How to explore data with python without the use of Pandas and Numpy.
